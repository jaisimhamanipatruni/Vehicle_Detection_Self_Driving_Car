# Vehicle-Detection-CNNs
Vehicle Detection for Self-Driving Cars 

The repository aims to provide detection of on-road vehicles for Self-Driving Cars via TensorFlow Object Detection API.
The API has been trained on the COCO dataset (Common Objects in Context). 
This is a dataset of 300k images of 90 most commonly found objects.
The API provides 5 different CNN models.
The current .ipynb file uses MobileNet.
The .ipynb and .html files are in Python-Files folder. 
The input and output images and videos are Test-Images and Output-Images folder. 
The input and output videos are in Videos folder.
